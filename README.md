This project was carried out purposely to provide a software system (web-based and mobile app) that can assist COVID-19 patients who are undergoing their quarantine to handle their home, and mental stress. 
 
The main functionality of the system includes providing current information on National COVID-19 cases and the latest Standard Operating Procedure as well as providing some comforting advice from the professional consultation. Other purposes of the software system developed also include providing some psychological relief to patients such as music and words of encouragement as well as helping patients to focus on using their time wisely such as setting their life goals, identifying important things in their lives, and providing ways for them to express concerns and anxiety.
